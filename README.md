### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a game developer, currently working with Unreal Engine 4.
In my free time I like working non game related stuff. My current interests are programming language design/compiler developement and text editors.

My current project is [Absytree](https://github.com/Nimaoth/Absytree), a text editor and structured programming language environment.
